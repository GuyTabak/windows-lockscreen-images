# windows-lockscreen-images

Utility to save the images windows has displayed at the lockscreen. The duration of time archived is unkown.
By examining creation time at %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets
we can see files dated two months back (The above path is the location at which windows saves the images).

To use the software, either run the executable in the location at which you desire to save the files.
Two folders will be created, one for horisontal and another for horizontal layout.
